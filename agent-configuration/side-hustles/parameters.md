# User Parameter Settings

## Temperature

The user should be able to define a desired degree of creativity on the part of the agent. 

The desired personality can be expressed on a skill from one to 5, and this desire should be translated into a temperature setting for the agent. 

The one to five scale should be as follows:

1 - would involve the agent generating minimally creative suggestions for site hustles. At the setting, the agent would take a very conservative approach, looking at the user's resume and background and thinking about the most obvious ways that they could perhaps generate a side income.

5- Would involve the agent suggesting highly creative, unconventional and sometimes even absurd suggestions for how the user could create a side hustle
