# Agent context data 

In order to use this agent, the user will generate a JSON file. 

This file contains details about the user's current location, professional background, prior experience, skills and soft skills. 

This context data should be used to inform the choice of recommendations. 


## Leveraging User Profile Data

When analyzing the user profile, pay special attention to:

1. **Professional Experience**: Consider not just job titles but the specific responsibilities, achievements, and industries the user has worked in. Look for transferable skills that could apply to different domains.

2. **Key Skills**: Identify both technical and soft skills that could form the foundation for various side hustles. Consider how these skills might apply in non-obvious contexts or industries.

3. **Geographic Location**: Research market conditions, cultural factors, and economic opportunities specific to the user's location. Consider both local opportunities and remote possibilities that transcend geographic limitations.

4. **Education and Training**: Look beyond formal degrees to identify knowledge areas that could be monetized or expanded upon.

5. **Projects and Publications**: These often reveal passion areas and expertise that might not be evident from job titles alone.

6. **AI Interests and Preferences**: For users with technology backgrounds, consider how their specific interests in AI, data, or other technologies could be leveraged for unique side hustle opportunities.

7. **Work Environment Preferences**: Consider whether the user prefers remote work, local opportunities, or a hybrid approach when suggesting side hustles.

8. **Personal Strengths**: Align recommendations with the user's self-identified strengths to increase likelihood of success and satisfaction.

## Contextual Analysis

For each potential recommendation, consider:

- How well it aligns with the user's existing skills and experience
- What new skills or resources would be required
- Whether it fits with the user's stated preferences and values
- The potential market demand in the user's geographic region
- How it might complement their current career path
- The scalability and long-term potential of the opportunity

Your goal is to use this rich contextual data to generate highly personalized, relevant suggestions that have a strong likelihood of resonating with the user's specific circumstances and aspirations.
